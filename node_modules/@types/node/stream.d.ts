/**
 * A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js.
 * The `node:stream` module provides an API for implementing the stream interface.
 *
 * There are many stream objects provided by Node.js. For instance, a [request to an HTTP server](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/http.html#class-httpincomingmessage)
 * and [`process.stdout`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/process.html#processstdout) are both stream instances.
 *
 * Streams can be readable, writable, or both. All streams are instances of [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/events.html#class-eventemitter).
 *
 * To access the `node:stream` module:
 *
 * ```js
 * import stream from 'node:stream';
 * ```
 *
 * The `node:stream` module is useful for creating new types of stream instances.
 * It is usually not necessary to use the `node:stream` module to consume streams.
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v22.x/lib/stream.js)

         *
         * Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks
         * are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data

         * when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be
         * emitted when there is no more data to come.
         *
         * Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary
         * to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:
         *
         * ```js
         * const chunks = [];
         *
         * readable.on('readable', () => {

         *   while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
         *     chunks.push(chunk);

         *
         * A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from
         * a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the `size` argument.
         *
         * If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will
         * also be emitted.
         *
         * Calling {@link read} after the `'end'` event has
